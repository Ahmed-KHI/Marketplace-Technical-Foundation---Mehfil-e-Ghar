**DAY : 6**

**DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION AND STAGING ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

Overview

On Day 6, the focus is on preparing the deployment pipeline and setting up a staging environment. This ensures the marketplace project can be thoroughly tested in an environment that mirrors production before going live.

Objectives

Establish a staging environment for pre-production testing.

Configure deployment workflows for a smooth transition to production.

Test the staging setup for performance, scalability, and reliability.

Deployment Preparation

Codebase Optimization:
Minify JavaScript, CSS, and other assets for faster load times.

Remove unused dependencies and ensure the code is clean.

Conduct final reviews of key modules (authentication, product management, etc.).

CI/CD Pipeline Setup:
Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate the deployment process.

Configure the pipeline to include steps like:

Code linting and formatting.

Automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end).

Deployment to the staging environment.

Deployment Tools:
Select and configure hosting platforms.

Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.

Implement version control tags to track releases.

Staging Environment Setup

Infrastructure Configuration:
Create a staging server or environment identical to production.

Use separate databases and API keys to avoid conflicts with live data.

Testing:
Perform comprehensive testing in the staging environment:

Test all APIs and endpoints for correctness.

Validate UI responsiveness across devices and browsers.

Simulate high traffic to test scalability.

Data Setup:
Populate the staging database with sample data for testing purposes.

Ensure all migrations are applied and tested.

Security Measures

Use HTTPS for all communication in the staging environment.

Restrict access to the staging environment using IP whitelisting or authentication.

Regularly monitor logs for any suspicious activities.

Notes

Document the deployment and staging processes for team collaboration.

Keep backups of all configurations and critical data.

Monitor staging performance metrics to identify potential bottlenecks.

Conclusion

Deployment preparation and staging environment setup are essential to ensure a smooth transition to production. These steps provide a safe space to test features, identify bugs, and optimize performance before the marketplace goes live.
